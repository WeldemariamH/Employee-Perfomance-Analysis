# Employee-Perfomance-Analysis
## Overview
This repository contains the code and analysis for the Employee Performance Analysis project. The analysis explores the factors influencing employee performance using data from Kaggle, involving more than 15,000 employees. The raw data was imported into a MySQL database, cleaned, and transformed to create new necessary columns. The analysis is presented through 11 visualizations in Power BI.
## Project Structure
- `data/`: This folder contains the raw data downloaded from Kaggle and the cleaned dataset exported from MySQL.
- `My SQL script/`: SQL scripts used for data import, cleaning, and transformation.
- `powerbi_report/`: Power BI files containing the visualizations and analysis.
## Data Cleaning and Transformation
1. Raw data from Kaggle was imported into a MySQL database.
2. Data cleaning and transformation scripts are performed on my local My Sql.
3. Necessary columns were created to facilitate the analysis.
## Power BI Analysis
The Power BI analysis focuses on the impact of various factors on employee performance. 11 different visualizations were created to analyze the employees performance through diverce perspective:
## Usage
To replicate the analysis:
- Execute the `My SQL script/` in the order provided.
- Open the Power BI files in `powerbi_report/` to explore the visualizations.
## Requirements
